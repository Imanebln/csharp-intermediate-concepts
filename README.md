# C# Intermediate Concepts

In this tutorial, we are going to learn about C# intermediate concepts. We will try to show how to write C# code in an object-oriented manner and how to use the object-oriented concepts while writing that code.

## To learn about the OOP concept, we are going to cover the following topics:

 - Classes and Constructors
 - Properties
 - Static Members, Constants, and Extension Methods
 - Anonymous and Nullable Types
 - Structures
 - Enumerations
 - Inheritance
 - Interfaces
 - Abstract Classes
 - Generics
 - Queue, Stack, Hashtable
   - [Queue](./csharp-intermediate-concepts/Queue-Stack-Hashtable/QueueCollection.cs)
   - [Stack](./csharp-intermediate-concepts/Queue-Stack-Hashtable/StackCollection.cs)
   - [Hashtable](./csharp-intermediate-concepts/Queue-Stack-Hashtable/HashtableCollection.cs)
 - Generic List and Dictionary
   - [List](./csharp-intermediate-concepts/List-and-Dictionary/List.cs)
   - [Dictionary](./csharp-intermediate-concepts/List-and-Dictionary/Dictionary.cs)
 - [Delegates](./csharp-intermediate-concepts/Delegates)


## Definitions

###### Queue Collection:
 - The queue collection represents a first-in, first-out collection of objects. This means that we can place our objects in a queue collection in a certain order and remove those objects by the same order. So, the first object which goes in is the first object to go out.

###### Stack Collection:
 - A stack collection represents a simple last-in, first-out collection. It means that an element which enters first in a collection will exit last.

###### Hashtable:
 - The Hashtable represents a collection of a key-value pair that is organized based on the hash code of the key. Differently, from the queue and stack collections, we can instantiate a hashtable object by using the only System.Collections namespace.

###### List:
 - A List represents a strongly typed collection of objects that can be accessed by index.

###### Dictionary:
 - Dictionary represents a collection of keys and values.
